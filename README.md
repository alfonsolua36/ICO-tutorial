### ICO-tutorial

## The following are required in order to create your first ICO on the Ethereum blockchain!
- 📃 Ethereum Address (Ropsten Network) [We will be using the Ropsten Network to test out our ICO before laucnhing onto the mainnet!]
- 🪙 Some Ethereum (Ropsten Network)
- 📜 Text Editor (I.e Sublime/Atom)
- 📝 Solidity Contract
- 🤞 A bunch of lucky charms during this process. 

Before we start credit to [Moritz Neto][1]!

## To Start
- Open the contract you downloaded in your Text Editor.
- Go to Line 3–15 and look at the comment section. Although this is a comment section, this will help you down the track. The name of the template ICO is ‘bitfwd’ CROWDSALE token contract
- Change Line 4 to the title of your crowdsale.
- You will just change Line 6 after you deploy the contract on the Blockchain.
- Change Line 7’s Symbol to your respective coin name (Keep it short)
- Change Line 8 to the name of your token
